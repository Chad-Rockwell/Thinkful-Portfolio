            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>
              Growing up I always enjoyed creating new things and solving
              problems. <br />
              If something ever wasn't working right, <br />
              I'd always find a way to get to the bottom of it. <br />
              I first fell in love with code back in 2018. <br />
              <a
                class="zelda"
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rPxiXXxftE"
                target="_blank"
              >
                Breath of The Wild
              </a>
              really inspired me to get into making video games myself. <br />
              I began to learn C# and the Unity Framework but quickly realized,
              <br />
              developing entire projects on your own is a lot of work! <br />
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>
              Through this experience, I learned how much I liked making things
              <br />
              with code. <br />
              Though I took a break and went back to focusing on my music,
              <br />
              I still remember how satisfying it was to debug things and have
              them working again. <br />
              As a music producer, I am used to troubleshooting and working with
              others <br />
              on large projects. <br />
              In the future, I'm hoping to make the most of those skills and the
              skills <br />
              that I am now building as a software developer.
